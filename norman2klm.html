    <h2>Model-Based Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      In Human–Computer Interaction, different cognitive models are used
      to analyse user behaviour. Each model focuses on a different level
      of interaction, such as understanding user thinking, task structure,
      or execution speed.

    <h2>Norman’s Action Cycle</h2>
    <img src="NormanActionCycle.jpg" alt="Norman’s seven-stage action cycle">
    <p>
      Norman’s model focuses on the mental process of interaction.
      It explains how users decide what to do, perform actions,
      and check whether the system response matches their goal.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Establishing the goal:</strong> This is the user’s notion of what needs to be done and is framed in terms of the domain, in the task language.</li>
      <li><strong>Forming the intention:</strong> The goal is translated into the more specific intention to reach the goal.</li>
      <li><strong>Specifying the action sequence:</strong> The intention is translated into the actual actions that will reach the goal, before it can be executed by the user.</li>
      <li><strong>Executing the action:</strong> The user performs the physical action sequence to interact with the system.</li>
      <li><strong>Perceiving the system state:</strong> The user perceives the new state of the system, after execution of the action sequence.</li>
      <li><strong>Interpreting the system state:</strong> The user interprets the perceived state in terms of his expectations.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluating the system state with respect to the goals and intentions:</strong> The user evaluates the new state according to the original goals to see if the interaction has been successful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The model highlights two common problems:
      The gulf of execution 
      (the difference between the user’s formulation of the actions to reach the goal 
      and the actions allowed by the system) and the gulf of evaluation (the distance 
      between the physical presentation of the system state and the expectation of the user).
    </p>

    <p>
      Norman’s execution–evaluation cycle is used within
      cognitive walkthroughs as an expert-based evaluation method.
      Evaluators examine whether users can understand the feedback they
      receive after each action and whether the system state clearly
      supports the user’s goals, without involving actual users.

    <h2>GOMS Model</h2>
    <img src="GOMS-model.png" alt="The GOMS Model">
    <p>
      GOMS describes how an experienced user completes a task,
      focusing on the structure of actions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goals:</strong> These are the user’s goals, describing what the user wants to achieve. 
        In GOMS, goals also represent a memory point to which the user may return to evaluate actions 
        or recover from errors.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Operators:</strong> These are the lowest level of analysis and are the basic actions 
        that the user must perform to use the system. Operators may affect the system 
        (e.g., pressing a key) or only the user’s mental state (e.g., reading a dialog box).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Methods:</strong> These are the procedures for accomplishing goals. A goal can be 
        decomposed into subgoals in several ways, and each alternative decomposition is called a method 
        (e.g., closing a window using a menu option or a function key).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Selection Rules:</strong> These specify how the user chooses between different methods 
        when more than one method is available to achieve the same goal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      According to Chapter 9 (Section 9.3.3), GOMS is also used as a
      model-based expert evaluation technique. It allows designers to
      analyse user performance and compare task efficiency without
      direct user involvement, combining design specification and
      evaluation within the same framework.

    <h2>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h2>
    <img src="KLM-Model.jpg" alt="The KLM Model">
    <p>
      KLM (Keystroke-Level Model) uses the human motor system to predict user performance for unit tasks, typically under 20 seconds. Complex tasks are split into subtasks (as in GOMS). The task has two phases: acquisition and execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      KLM predicts only the execution phase. The model decomposes execution into physical motor operators, a mental operator, and a system response operator:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>K: Keystroking, actually striking keys, including shifts and other modifier keys.</li>
      <li>B: Pressing a mouse button.</li>
      <li>P: Pointing, moving the mouse (or similar device) at a target.</li>
      <li>H: Homing, switching the hand between mouse and keyboard.</li>
      <li>D: Drawing lines using the mouse.</li>
      <li>M: Mentally preparing for a physical action.</li>
      <li>R: System response which may be ignored if the user does not have to wait for it.</li>
    </ul>

      KLM as a lower-level modeling technique that
      provides precise predictions of the time required for low-level
      physical actions. Compared to GOMS, KLM is more granular and focuses
      purely on execution rather than planning or decision-making (from Chapter 9).

    <h2>Example: Correcting a Typing Error</h2>
    <p>
      If a user notices a wrong character and corrects it,
      KLM represents the task as a sequence of low-level actions
      such as moving the mouse, pressing keys, and waiting for feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shows that KLM only models execution, not thinking
      about what to do.
